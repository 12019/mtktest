 *     components and manages stack initialization and deinitialization. Refer
 *     to the documentation in each function for specific instructions
 *     on how it interacts with the operating system integration layer
 *     (OS API).

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVM_StartTimer()
 *
 *     Called by stack layers to start a timer. After the specified
 *     amount of time elapses, the timer fires by calling the timer's
 *     callback function. The timer fires only once for each call to
 *     EVM_StartTimer().
 *
 *     If the timer was already running, this function resets it with a
 *     new time period.
 *
 *     Internally, timers are managed by calling OS_GetSystemTime during
 *     stack execution. When XA_MULTITASKING is enabled, this function
 *     uses OS_StartTimer, which maps to a single system timer.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     timer - Pointer to a timer structure. The caller must
 *         initialize the func field, and may also initialize the context
 *         field if desired. When the timer fires, timer.func is called
 *         during stack execution. NOTE: The timer.func will typically check
 *         for Hold, Park or Sniff mode with ME_GetCurrentMode when called
 *         and handle these modes differently (usually restarting the timer
 *         is sufficient.)
 *
 *     ms - Number of milliseconds to wait before firing. This value
 *         is converted to system ticks using the MS_TO_TICKS macro.

/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVM_CancelTimer()
 *
 *     Called by the stack to cancel a timer. This prevents the timer
 *     from firing.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     timer - Pointer to a timer structure. The timer must have been
 *         started by EVM_StartTimer and must not have fired or
 *         been cancelled already.
